 ** Description: This program will be a battle simulation between two teams of creatures. The players will be able to choose from 5 characters to fill their team. The characters will battle until one team is out of players and then a score will be tallied to decide who the winner is. The losing character in each battle will be removed from the team, and the winner will go to the back of the queue of the player's team.
