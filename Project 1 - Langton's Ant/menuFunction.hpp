 ** Program name: Langton's Ant
 ** Author: John Olgin
 ** Date: 4/15/17
 ** Description: This program will ultimately run a simulation of Langton's Ant. As the ant moves (according to the color of the current box) the program will print out the 2D Array for the user to see. The user will be prompted to start or exit the program, input the number of rows/columns, specify starting position if they choose to do so, and choose how many steps they want the program to iterate through. In order to run this program, main.cpp, menuFunction.cpp, menuFunction.hpp, inputValidation.cpp, inputValidation.hpp, Ant.cpp, and Ant.hpp need to be in the same folder and compiled together.
